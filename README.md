# Description

This project is inspired by the Filamentalis and the TurtleBox, using four modified Filamentalists, each equipped with an independent extruder. The extruders are slightly inclined to optimize the filament path.

The extruder design allows for the use of either NEMA 17 or NEMA 14 motors. However, I have achieved better results with the NEMA 17, so the choice is yours.

The system includes a Y-splitter with a switch and a Binky encoder. Each lane has status LEDs to monitor each filament, and a filament eject button makes it easy to remove the material.

The logo features an LED strip that shows the MMU status (load, unload, and the color of the loaded filament). The entire design is 3D printed, eliminating the need for aluminum extrusions.
